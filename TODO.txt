COMPLETED:

1. Create detection pipeline by integrating MobileNetv2-SSD code
2. Implement CAM mode for online tracking
3. Evaluation on MOT16:
    a. Generate pre-computed bboxes + detections using SSD
    b. Generate tracking results for MOT16 training data with EVAL mode using both default and SSD detections separately
    c. Use Py-MOT-metrics library to generate a set of metrics for each case - Benchmark results saved in ./Results/Task-1/benchmark_results.txt
4. Extend the code to track vehicles in a given video file
5. Evaluation on UA-DETRAC:
    a. Generate detections using given DPM and FRCNN bboxes, and pre-computed bboxes + detections using SSD
    b. Generate tracking results for all three using a base case (min_confidence=0.4, max_cosine_distance=0.2)
    c. Compute benchmark metrics


-----------------------------

TODO:

1. Perform sensitivity analysis (cosineThresh expt) for both human and vehicle tracking


2. Add SSD online detection mode for vehicles -- for measuring online operation FPS
