1. Collect EVAL data (with both default and SSD detections) for all MOT16 train sequences(because they have ground truths)

2. Set up the benchmark code and integrate it into the project

3. Compute metrics for original 'EVAL' on MOT16 train data.
   Compute the metrics for the new 'EVAL' (with SSD detector).
   Compare.
