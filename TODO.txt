1. Create a function that generates bboxes using SSD: benchmarking would be faster
    - Create the new code file in Tools for generating bboxes as custom det files
    - In generate_detections, use the custom det files to generate detections

2. Set up the benchmark code and integrate it into the project

3. Reproduce original 'eval' results. Produce the new 'eval' (with SSD detector) results.
   Compare using all the tracking metrics (no FPS).
