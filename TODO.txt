COMPLETED:

1. Create detection pipeline by integrating MobileNetv2-SSD code
2. Implement CAM mode for online tracking
3. Evaluation:
    a. Create pre-computed bboxes and detections using SSD
    b. Generate tracking results for MOT16 training data with EVAL mode using both default and SSD detections separately
    c. Use Py-MOT-metrics library to generate a set of metrics for each case - Benchmark results saved in ./Results/Task-1/benchmark_results.txt


TODO:

1. Check and confirm the MOT metrics
2. Check vehicle detection code


MISC. TODO:

1. DeepSORT paper benchmark results are computed using a different detector (from paper “Poi:Multiple object tracking with high performance detection and appearance feature"). Use this to reproduce the benchmark results and compare with my results.
