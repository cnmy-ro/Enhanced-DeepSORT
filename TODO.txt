COMPLETED:

1. Create detection pipeline by integrating MobileNetv2-SSD code
2. Implement CAM mode for online tracking
3. Evaluation:
    a. Create pre-computed bboxes and detections using SSD
    b. Generate tracking results for MOT16 training data with EVAL mode using both default and SSD detections separately
    c. Use Py-MOT-metrics library to generate a set of metrics for each case - Benchmark results saved in ./Results/Task-1/benchmark_results.txt
4. Extend the code to track vehicles in a given video file


-----------------------------

LINGERING DOUBTS:

1. How reliable are the MOT16 benchmark results of Task-1? To clear this, complete evaluation of the MOT16 set (training + test) needs to be done with MISC.TODO #1 to reproduce originial DeepSORT paper results.


-----------------------------

TODO:

1. Evaluate vehicle tracking qualitatively. Check if this can be done quantitatively with KITTI or similar
2. Read the speed-up paper and implement the method


-----------------------------

MISC. TODO:

1. DeepSORT paper benchmark results are computed using a different detector (from paper “Poi:Multiple object tracking with high performance detection and appearance feature"). Use this to reproduce the benchmark results and compare with my results.
